 * 
 * I'll be rewriting this client for a while.. try working on the server or
 * playing with MasterClient it needs a GUI. or, you can play with mySQL and sha1.
 * 
 * 
 * the mysql for our server is username: test  and password: hypn0sh1t
 * 
 * i trust you know the address and port number.

 * 
 * 
 * if there are anythings mentioned about OS specifics like dlls and such, remember, the the server
 * will be running on a debain 6 linux system with mono.
 * 
 * 
 * if you need to leave messages for me, do so in the TODO file. i will check it periodically on all
 * of our projects.
 * 
 * but yeah, i'll be working on the client for the 10 days you're gone.
